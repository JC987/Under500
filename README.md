This project is made using react native and firebase. I am using firebase to handle user authentication and cloud storage. I am creating the project in order to teach my self react native and firebase. I have a passion and interest for mobile development and have already developed android apps using java and android studio for over a year now. So I feel react native would be a fun thing to try out and learn.</p>
