<h1>Under 500</h1>

<p><strong>Under 500</strong> is a web/mobile app built using react-native that will allow users to read/write short stories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction" target="_blank"> (flash-fiction)</a> that are 500 words or less. Right now this repo is just filled with hardcoded data to mock up how the app will look/flow.

I am creating the project in order to teach my self react native. I have a passion and intrest for mobile development and have already developed android apps using java and Android Studio for over a year now.</p>
